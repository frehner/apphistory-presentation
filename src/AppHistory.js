          Before the solution is shown: Remeber the problem we had earlier with
          anchor tags and history? Well, what kind of crazy solution do you
          think exists for that in app history?
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait, you say: there's no javascript here! And that's exactly the
          point. You now have this beautiful, semantic HTML, no javascript, and
          it will still go through AppHistory.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important note here: what if someone has JS disabled? This still
          works - it just does a full page refresh, since it's just a normal
          anchor tag. And if you do have JS enabled, then they get the enhanced
          single-page experience. A win for the web, right?

          (If you squint a little bit, does it look like that baby on the far
          right has a goatee?) Looking back at our sharing issues, it really
          comes down to the fact that devs were forced to create libraries for
          something that maybe should have just been part of the platform from
          the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we can resolve the issue of sharing things like
          navigation events by just having a standard DOM event that anyone can
          listen to and react to, as shown on line 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, let's look at what's happening on line 3: anyone can add
          their own promise or promises to that navigation event. This means
          anyone can come in and say "hey, I need data for this specific url",
          and you don't have to worry about it. 3rd party widgets or custom
          elements can now just do their own thing and still participate in
          routing events, making them become way more sharable and reusable
          across sites. This API has been built with sharing in mind!

        <p>
          We talked about how there were several issues with the history stack -
          how you couldn't see it for various reasons, how state could go
          missing, and how other things like iframes could add unwanted entries
          into your site's navigation stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          App History's history (or entry) stack locks down the things that need
          to be, and allows the things you need as well: - no iframe entries, no
          missing state, and you can get the whole list at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, this also sounds like it could be potentially something you
          could integrate wtih your bug reporting tool, right? if the app
          crashes or there's a big error, let's get the last 5 entries, and add
          that to the error trace so we can pretty clearly see where the user
          was and where they went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, it's not something I'm going to dig into in this talk, but each
          entry has information in it, such as IDs, keys, urls, and a getState()
          method.

            I actually don't know what this Web 3.0 stuff is, and I don't
            actually think of App History as some sort of angel that will save
            us from history's sins or whatever.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the hope is that App History can fix some of those glaring
            issues while hopefully not introducing new ones. So, with the
            knowledge of some of the headaches that history has, let's see how
            app history hopefully cleans things up

      <Notes>
        <p>
          Remember how anyone can add a promise to the navigation event, and
          this is an API the browser is in charge of? This one standardized
          event gives browsers a clear signal it can watch for to know 1) that
          there's a transition happening, and 2) how long it's taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          For loading, the browser could use their normal "page loading" UI that
          it does for a full page refresh or navigation, but for your
          single-page navigations!
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, browsers can also notify assistive technologies that a
          navigation is happening, that it's a single-page navigation, and how
          long that navigation is taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, it also makes keeping track of app metrics such as page
          transitions and timing a lot easier and standardized.

      <Notes>
        <p>
          Each navigate event comes with an abort signal. An abort signal is a
          standardized tool used in various APIs to signal that an event has
          been cancelled/stopped. You can use this signal to setup some logic to
          know if the navigation is cancelled (for example, maybe the user hits
          the stop button in the browser UI)
        </p>
        <p>
          The other nice thing about AbortSignals is that they can be used
          natively with fetch, to essentially "cancel" the fetch and help
          prevent your app from doing additional work when the promise resolves.
